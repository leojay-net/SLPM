üîç SLPM Issue Analysis & Resolution
==========================================

## ‚ùå Issue Identified: No STRK Token Transfer

**Problem:** Your STRK balance wasn't decreasing because the contract was only recording commitments but **not actually transferring STRK tokens** from your wallet to the contract.

### Root Cause
The original contract had placeholder functions:
```cairo
// TODO: Implement actual STRK token transfer
// This would typically call the STRK contract's transfer function
```

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented: STRK Token Integration

### New Contract Features
1. **Real STRK Token Interface** - Added ERC20 interface for STRK transfers
2. **Actual Token Transfers** - `transfer_from()` in deposit, `transfer()` in withdrawal
3. **STRK Token Address** - Configured with Sepolia testnet STRK token
4. **Admin Functions** - Can check and manage STRK token address

### New Contract Details
- **Address:** `0x046433427caaf46e6f4750e7b306410465977bd155a1237657d134d64c40a343`
- **STRK Token:** `0x04718f5a0fc34cc1af16a1cdee98ffb20c31f5cd61d6ab07201858f4287c938d` (Sepolia)
- **Class Hash:** `0x00ea2c51cb3f31fcba8fd8fa0f9c6d8b0d15289db4b5838fe78c917a8a7dce07`

## üîÑ How It Works Now

### Deposit Flow
1. User connects wallet (ArgentX/Braavos)
2. User approves STRK spending to mixer contract  
3. User calls `deposit()` with commitment + amount
4. Contract calls `STRK.transfer_from(user, contract, amount)`
5. **STRK tokens actually move** from user to contract ‚úÖ
6. Privacy commitment is stored

### Withdrawal Flow  
1. User provides nullifier + proof after mixing
2. Contract validates privacy proof
3. Contract calls `STRK.transfer(recipient, amount)`
4. **STRK tokens move** from contract to recipient ‚úÖ

## üö® Important: User Must Approve STRK Spending

Before depositing, users need to approve the mixer contract to spend their STRK:

```javascript
// In the frontend, before calling deposit:
await strkContract.approve(mixerContractAddress, depositAmount);
```

## üß™ Testing the Real Transfers

### Browser Testing Steps
1. **Start the server:** `npm run dev`
2. **Connect wallet** (ArgentX/Braavos)
3. **Approve STRK spending** to mixer contract
4. **Make a deposit** - Your STRK balance will decrease ‚úÖ
5. **Check contract balance** - Contract will hold your STRK
6. **Complete withdrawal** - STRK transfers to recipient ‚úÖ

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Check STRK token address
sncast call --contract-address 0x046433427caaf46e6f4750e7b306410465977bd155a1237657d134d64c40a343 --function get_strk_token

# Check contract STRK balance  
sncast call --contract-address 0x04718f5a0fc34cc1af16a1cdee98ffb20c31f5cd61d6ab07201858f4287c938d --function balance_of --calldata 0x046433427caaf46e6f4750e7b306410465977bd155a1237657d134d64c40a343
```

## üìä Expected Behavior Now

### Before Deposit
- User STRK balance: X tokens
- Contract STRK balance: 0 tokens

### After Deposit  
- User STRK balance: X - deposit_amount tokens ‚úÖ
- Contract STRK balance: deposit_amount tokens ‚úÖ

### After Withdrawal
- Recipient STRK balance: +withdrawal_amount tokens ‚úÖ
- Contract STRK balance: deposit_amount - withdrawal_amount tokens ‚úÖ

## üéØ Ready for Real Testing

The privacy mixer now handles **actual STRK token transfers**. When you test in the browser:

1. Your STRK balance **will decrease** when depositing ‚úÖ
2. Contract **will hold** your STRK during mixing ‚úÖ  
3. Recipients **will receive** STRK after withdrawal ‚úÖ
4. Complete **financial accountability** maintained ‚úÖ

The privacy guarantees remain the same, but now with real economic value transfer!
