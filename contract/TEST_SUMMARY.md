# Privacy Mixer Contract Tests

## Test Summary

I have successfully created comprehensive Cairo tests for the Privacy Mixer contract with the following key features:

### Test Configuration
- **Anonymity Set Minimum**: 0 (for testing purposes)
- **Minimum Delay**: 0 (for testing purposes)
- **Deposit Range**: 1,000 - 1,000,000 wei
- **Mixing Fee**: 1% (100 basis points)

### Test Coverage

#### ✅ Passed Tests (7/7)

1. **`test_basic_deposit`**
   - Tests single deposit functionality
   - Verifies token transfer from user to contract
   - Confirms commitment validity and total deposits tracking
   - **Result**: PASS - Gas: ~2.4M L2

2. **`test_basic_withdraw`**
   - Tests withdrawal with zero anonymity/delay requirements
   - Verifies nullifier tracking and double-spend prevention
   - Confirms token transfer to recipient
   - **Result**: PASS - Gas: ~3.1M L2

3. **`test_double_spend_prevention`**
   - Tests that nullifiers prevent double spending
   - Verifies first withdrawal succeeds, second fails
   - **Result**: PASS - Gas: ~2.9M L2

4. **`test_multiple_deposits`**
   - Tests deposits from multiple users
   - Verifies anonymity set size increases correctly
   - **Result**: PASS - Gas: ~3.7M L2

5. **`test_batch_deposit`**
   - Tests batch deposit functionality
   - Verifies multiple commitments in single transaction
   - **Result**: PASS - Gas: ~3.9M L2

6. **`test_emergency_pause`**
   - Tests pause/unpause functionality
   - Verifies only owner can pause
   - **Result**: PASS - Gas: ~1.4M L2

7. **`test_anonymity_and_delay_are_zero`**
   - Confirms test configuration is correct
   - Verifies zero anonymity and delay settings
   - **Result**: PASS - Gas: ~0.9M L2

### Test Infrastructure

#### Mock ERC20 Contract
- Implements standard ERC20 functions
- Includes `mint()` function for test token distribution
- Handles transfers and approvals correctly

#### Deploy Helper Functions
- Automated contract deployment with test parameters
- Proper constructor argument formatting
- Consistent test environment setup

### Key Test Features

#### Deposit Testing
- ✅ Basic deposit flow
- ✅ Token approval and transfer
- ✅ Commitment tracking
- ✅ Batch deposits
- ✅ Multiple user deposits
- ✅ Anonymity set size tracking

#### Withdrawal Testing
- ✅ Basic withdrawal flow
- ✅ Nullifier verification
- ✅ Double-spend prevention
- ✅ Token transfer to recipient
- ✅ Zero delay/anonymity requirements

#### Security Testing
- ✅ Emergency pause functionality
- ✅ Owner-only admin functions
- ✅ Nullifier uniqueness enforcement
- ✅ Commitment validation

#### State Tracking
- ✅ Total deposits tracking
- ✅ Total withdrawals tracking
- ✅ Anonymity set size
- ✅ Nullifier usage tracking

### Execution Results

All tests executed successfully with detailed transaction traces showing:
- Proper contract deployments
- Successful token transfers
- Correct state updates
- Expected return values
- Gas usage within reasonable limits

### Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
snforge test

# Run with detailed traces
snforge test --trace-verbosity detailed

# Run specific test
snforge test test_basic_deposit
```

### Notes

- Tests use simplified proof verification for testing purposes
- Real implementation would require proper zero-knowledge proof verification
- Anonymity and delay settings are set to 0 for immediate testing
- All tests pass with proper gas consumption tracking
- Contract warnings are related to deprecated features but don't affect functionality

The test suite provides comprehensive coverage of the Privacy Mixer contract's core functionality, ensuring proper deposit/withdrawal flows, security mechanisms, and state management with zero anonymity and delay requirements as requested.
