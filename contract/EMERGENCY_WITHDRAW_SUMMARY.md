### Emergency Withdraw Function Signature:

```cairo
fn emergency_withdraw(ref self: ContractState, recipient: ContractAddress) -> u256
```

### Key Safety Guarantees:

- ✅ **No Fund Loss**: Owner can always recover all funds
- ✅ **Access Control**: Only contract owner can trigger emergency withdrawal
- ✅ **Complete Recovery**: Withdraws entire contract balance
- ✅ **State Consistency**: Resets all counters after withdrawal
- ✅ **Event Logging**: Full audit trail of emergency actions
- ✅ **Recipient Validation**: Prevents accidental fund loss to zero address

### Usage Example:

```cairo
// Only the contract owner can call this
let withdrawn_amount = mixer.emergency_withdraw(recovery_address);
// Returns: total amount withdrawn
// Effect: All STRK tokens transferred to recovery_address
// State: Contract counters reset to 0
```

The emergency withdraw feature is now fully implemented and tested, ensuring no funds can ever be permanently locked in the contract!
