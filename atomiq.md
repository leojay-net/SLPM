atomiqlabs SDK
A typescript multichain client for atomiqlabs trustlesss cross-chain swaps. Enables trustless swaps between smart chains (Solana, EVM, Starknet, etc.) and bitcoin (on-chain - L1 and lightning network - L2).

Example SDK integration in NodeJS available here

Installation
npm install @atomiqlabs/sdk
Installing chain-specific connectors
You can install only the chain-specific connectors that your project requires

npm install @atomiqlabs/chain-solana
npm install @atomiqlabs/chain-starknet

Preparations
Set Solana & Starknet RPC URL to use

const solanaRpc = "https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com";
const starknetRpc = "https://starknet-mainnet.public.blastapi.io/rpc/v0_7";
Create swapper factory, here we can pick and choose which chains we want to have supported in the SDK, ensure the "as const" keyword is used such that the typescript compiler can properly infer the types.

import {SolanaInitializer, SolanaInitializerType} from "@atomiqlabs/chain-solana";
import {StarknetInitializer, StarknetInitializerType} from "@atomiqlabs/chain-starknet";
import {SwapperFactory} from "@atomiqlabs/sdk";

const Factory = new SwapperFactory<[SolanaInitializerType, StarknetInitializerType]>([SolanaInitializer, StarknetInitializer] as const);
const Tokens = Factory.Tokens; //Get the supported tokens for all the specified chains.
Browser
This uses browser's Indexed DB by default

import {BitcoinNetwork} from "@atomiqlabs/sdk";

const swapper = Factory.newSwapper({
    chains: {
        SOLANA: {
            rpcUrl: solanaRpc //You can also pass Connection object here
        },
        STARKNET: {
            rpcUrl: starknetRpc //You can also pass Provider object here
        }
    },
    bitcoinNetwork: BitcoinNetwork.TESTNET //or BitcoinNetwork.MAINNET, BitcoinNetwork.TESTNET4 - this also sets the network to use for Solana (solana devnet for bitcoin testnet) & Starknet (sepolia for bitcoin testnet)
});
if you want to use custom pricing api, mempool.space RPC url, or tune HTTP request timeouts check out additional options

NodeJS
For NodeJS we need to use sqlite storage, for that we first need to install the sqlite storage adaptor

npm install @atomiqlabs/storage-sqlite
Then use pass it in the newSwapper function

import {SqliteStorageManager, SqliteUnifiedStorage} from "@atomiqlabs/storage-sqlite";
import {BitcoinNetwork} from "@atomiqlabs/sdk";

const swapper = Factory.newSwapper({
    chains: {
        SOLANA: {
            rpcUrl: solanaRpc //You can also pass Connection object here
        },
        STARKNET: {
            rpcUrl: starknetRpc //You can also pass Provider object here
        }
    },
    bitcoinNetwork: BitcoinNetwork.TESTNET, //or BitcoinNetwork.MAINNET - this also sets the network to use for Solana (solana devnet for bitcoin testnet) & Starknet (sepolia for bitcoin testnet)
    //The following lines are important for running on backend node.js,
    // because the SDK by default uses browser's Indexed DB
    swapStorage: chainId => new SqliteUnifiedStorage("CHAIN_"+chainId+".sqlite3"),
    chainStorageCtor: name => new SqliteStorageManager("STORE_"+name+".sqlite3"),
});
if you want to use custom pricing api, mempool.space RPC url, or tune HTTP request timeouts check out additional options

Signer
import {SolanaSigner} from "@atomiqlabs/chain-solana";
//Browser - react, using solana wallet adapter
const anchorWallet = useAnchorWallet();
const wallet = new SolanaSigner(anchorWallet);
import {WalletAccount} from "starknet";
import {StarknetSigner} from "@atomiqlabs/chain-starknet";
//Browser, using get-starknet
const swo = await connect();
const wallet = new StarknetSigner(new WalletAccount(starknetRpc, swo.wallet));
or

import {Keypair} from "@solana/web3.js";
import {SolanaKeypairWallet, SolanaSigner} from "@atomiqlabs/chain-solana";
//Creating Solana signer from private key
const solanaSigner = new SolanaSigner(new SolanaKeypairWallet(Keypair.fromSecretKey(solanaKey)), Keypair.fromSecretKey(solanaKey));
import {SolanaKeypairWallet, SolanaSigner} from "@atomiqlabs/chain-solana";
//Creating Starknet signer from private key
const starknetSigner = new StarknetSigner(new StarknetKeypairWallet(starknetRpc, starknetKey));
Initialization
Initialize the swapper

await swapper.init();
Now we have the multichain swapper initialized

Extract chain-specific swapper with signer
To make it easier to do swaps between bitcoin and a specific chain we can extract a chain-specific swapper, and also set a signer. e.g.:

const solanaSwapper = swapper.withChain<"SOLANA">("SOLANA");
or also with signer

const starknetSwapperWithSigner = swapper.withChain<"STARKNET">("STARKNET").withSigner(signer);
Bitcoin on-chain swaps
Swap Smart chain -> Bitcoin on-chain
Getting swap quote

const _exactIn = false; //exactIn = false, so we specify the output amount
const _amount = 10000n; //Amount in BTC base units - sats (10000 sats = 0.0001 BTC)
const _address = "bc1qtw67hj77rt8zrkkg3jgngutu0yfgt9czjwusxt"; //BTC address of the recipient

//Create the swap: swapping SOL to Bitcoin on-chain, receiving _amount of satoshis (smallest unit of bitcoin) to _address
const swap = await swapper.swap(
    Tokens.SOLANA.SOL, //From specified source token
    Tokens.BITCOIN.BTC, //Swap to BTC
    _amount,
    _exactIn,
    solanaSigner.getAddress(), //Source address and smart chain signer
    _address //Destination of the swap
);

//Get the amount required to pay and fee
const input: string = swap.getInputWithoutFee().toString(); //Input amount excluding fees
const fee: string = swap.getFee().amountInSrcToken.toString(); //Fees paid on the output
const inputWithFees: string = swap.getInput().toString(); //Total amount paid including fees

const output: string = swap.getOutput().toString(); //Total output amount

//Get swap expiration time
const expiry: number = swap.getQuoteExpiry(); //Expiration time of the swap quote in UNIX milliseconds, swap needs to be initiated before this time

//Get pricing info
const swapPrice = swap.getPriceInfo().swapPrice; //Price of the current swap (excluding fees)
const marketPrice = swap.getPriceInfo().marketPrice; //Current market price
const difference = swap.getPriceInfo().difference; //Difference between the swap price & current market price
Initiating the swap

//Initiate and pay for the swap
await swap.commit(solanaSigner);
or sign and send transaction manually

Wait for the swap to execute, refund in case of failure

//Wait for the swap to conclude
const result: boolean = await swap.waitForPayment();
if(!result) {
    //Swap failed, money can be refunded
    await swap.refund();
} else {
    //Swap successful, we can get the bitcoin txId
    const bitcoinTxId = swap.getBitcoinTxId();
}

LNURLs & readable lightning identifiers
LNURLs extend the lightning network functionality by creating static lightning addreses (LNURL-pay & static internet identifiers) and QR codes which allow you to pull funds from them (LNURL-withdraw)

This SDK supports:

LNURL-pay (LUD-6, LUD-9, LUD-10, LUD-12)
LNURL-withdraw (LUD-3)
Static internet identifiers (LUD-16)
You can parse LNURLs and lightning invoices automatically using the Unified address parser

Differences
Lightning invoices:

One time use only
Need to have a fixed amount, therefore recipient has to set the amount
Static and bounded expiration
You can only pay to a lightning invoice, not withdraw funds from it
LNURLs & lightning identifiers:

Reusable
Programmable expiry
Allows payer to set an amount
Supports both, paying (LNURL-pay) and withdrawing (LNURL-withdraw)
Possibility to attach a message/comment to a payment
Receive a message/url as a result of the payment

Swap Bitcoin lightning network -> Smart chain
Getting swap quote

const _lnurl: string = "lnurl1dp68gurn8ghj7ampd3kx2ar0veekzar0wd5xjtnrdakj7tnhv4kxctttdehhwm30d3h82unvwqhkx6rfvdjx2ctvxyesuk0a27"; //Destination LNURL-pay or readable identifier
const _exactIn = true; //exactIn = true, so we specify the input amount
const _amount = 10000n; //Amount in BTC base units - sats

const swap = await swapper.swap(
    Tokens.BITCOIN.BTCLN, //Swap from BTC-LN
    Tokens.STARKNET.STRK, //Into specified destination token
    _amount,
    _exactIn, //Whether we define an input or output amount
    _lnurl, //Source LNURL for the swap
    signer.getAddress() //Destination address
);

//Get the amount required to pay and fee
const input: string = swap.getInputWithoutFee().toString(); //Input amount excluding fees
const fee: string = swap.getFee().amountInSrcToken.toString(); //Fees paid on the output
const inputWithFees: string = swap.getInput().toString(); //Total amount paid including fees

const output: string = swap.getOutput().toString(); //Total output amount

//Get swap expiration time
const expiry: number = swap.getQuoteExpiry(); //Expiration time of the swap quote in UNIX milliseconds, swap needs to be initiated before this time

//Get security deposit amount (Human readable amount of STRK that needs to be put down to rent the liquidity from swap intermediary), you will get this deposit back if the swap succeeds
const securityDeposit: string = swap.getSecurityDeposit().toString();

//Get pricing info
const swapPrice = swap.getPriceInfo().swapPrice; //Price of the current swap (excluding fees)
const marketPrice = swap.getPriceInfo().marketPrice; //Current market price
const difference = swap.getPriceInfo().difference; //Difference between the swap price & current market price
Wait for the payment to be received

//Start listening to incoming lightning network payment
const success = await swap.waitForPayment();
if(!success) {
    //Lightning network payment not received in time and quote expired!
    return;
}
Claim the funds on the destination smart chains, this settles the swap and lightning network payment

try {
    //Claim the swap funds - this will initiate 2 transactions
    if(swap.canCommitAndClaimInOneShot()) {
      //Some chains (e.g. Solana) support signing multiple transactions in one flow
      await swap.commitAndClaim(solanaSigner);
    } else {
      //Other chains (e.g. Starknet) don't support signing multiple transaction in one flow, therefore you need to sign one-by-one
      await swap.commit(starknetSigner);
      await swap.claim(starknetSigner);
    }
} catch(e) {
    //Error occurred while waiting for payment
}
or sign and send transactions manually

Getting state of the swap
You can get the current state of the swap with:

const state = swap.getState();
You can also set a listener to listen for swap state changes:

swap.events.on("swapState", swap => {
    const newState = swap.getState();
});
For the meaning of the states please refer to the "Swap state" section under each swap type.

Swap size limits
Swap sizes are limited by the LPs you are connected to, they are advertised in BTC terms by LPs during handshake

const swapLimits = swapper.getSwapLimits(srcToken, dstToken);
const inputMin = swapLimits.input.min;
const inputMax = swapLimits.input.max;
const outputMin = swapLimits.output.min;
const outputMax = swapLimits.output.max;
NOTE: swap limits denominated in BTC are retrieved from the LPs during initial handshake, however limits in other tokens are only returned when getting a quote fails due to amount being too low or too high. For example if you want to get swap limits for the BTC -> SOL swap, the input limits will be immediately available, while the output limits will only get populated once a quote request fails due to amount being too low or high.

let swapLimits = swapper.getSwapLimits(Tokens.BITCOIN.BTC, Tokens.SOLANA.SOL);
let inputMin = swapLimits.input.min; //Immediately available
let inputMax = swapLimits.input.max; //Immediately available
let outputMin = swapLimits.output.min; //Not available from the get-go
let outputMax = swapLimits.output.max; //Not available from the get-go

//You can also listen to swap limit changes (optional)
swapper.on("swapLimitsChanged", () => {
    //New limits available with swapper.getSwapLimits(srcToken, dstToken)
    //Useful in e.g. a react application where you want to dynamically set min/max swappable amount
})

//Try to swap really small amount of SOL with exactOut swap
try {
    const swap = await swapper.swap(
        Tokens.BITCOIN.BTC, //Swap from BTC
        Tokens.SOLANA.SOL, //Into specified destination token
        1n, //1 lamport = 0.000000001 SOL
        false, //Whether we define an input or output amount
        undefined, //Source address for the swap, not used for swaps from BTC
        solanaSigner.getAddress() //Destination address
    );
} catch (e) {
    //Fails with OutOfBoundsError
}

swapLimits = swapper.getSwapLimits(Tokens.BITCOIN.BTC, Tokens.SOLANA.SOL);
inputMin = swapLimits.input.min; //Immediately available
inputMax = swapLimits.input.max; //Immediately available
outputMin = swapLimits.output.min; //Now available due to failed quote
outputMax = swapLimits.output.max; //Now available due to failed quote
Stored swaps
Get swap by ID
You can retrieve a swap by it's id, you can get an ID of the swap with

const swapId = swap.getId();
And then later retrieve it from the storage

const swap = await swapper.getSwapById(id);
Get refundable swaps
You can refund the swaps in one of two cases:

In case intermediary is non-cooperative and goes offline, you can claim the funds from the swap contract back after some time.
In case intermediary tried to pay but was unsuccessful, so he sent you signed message with which you can refund now without waiting.
This call can be checked on every startup and periodically every few minutes.

//Get refundable swaps and refund them
const refundableSolanaSwaps = await swapper.getRefundableSwaps("SOLANA", solanaSigner.getAddress());
for(let swap of refundableSolanaSwaps) await swap.refund(solanaSigner);
const refundableStarknetSwaps = await swapper.getRefundableSwaps("STARKNET", starknetSigner.getAddress());
for(let swap of refundableStarknetSwaps) await swap.refund(starknetSigner);
Get claimable swaps
Returns swaps that are ready to be claimed by the client, this can happen if client closes the application when a swap is in-progress and the swap is concluded while the client is offline.

//Get the swaps
const claimableSolanaSwaps = await solanaSwapper.getClaimableSwaps("SOLANA", solanaSigner.getAddress());
//Claim all the claimable swaps
for(let swap of claimableSolanaSwaps) {
    if(swap.canCommit()) await swap.commit(solanaSigner); //This is for Bitcoin (lightning) -> Smart chain swaps, where commit & claim procedure might be needed
    await swap.claim(solanaSigner);
}
//Get the swaps
const claimableStarknetSwaps = await solanaSwapper.getClaimableSwaps("STARKNET", starknetSigner.getAddress());
//Claim all the claimable swaps
for(let swap of claimableStarknetSwaps) {
  if(swap.canCommit()) await swap.commit(starknetSigner); //This is for Bitcoin (lightning) -> Smart chain swaps, where commit & claim procedure might be needed
  await swap.claim(starknetSigner);
}
Helpers
Getting wallet balances
The SDK also contains helper functions for getting the maximum spendable balance of wallets

//Spendable balance of the starknet wallet address (discounting transaction fees)
const strkBalance = await swapper.Utils.getSpendableBalance(starknetSigner, Tokens.STARKNET.STRK);
//Spendable balance of the solana wallet address (discounting transaction fees)
const solBalance = await swapper.Utils.getSpendableBalance(solanaSigner, Tokens.SOLANA.SOL);
//Spendable balance of the bitcoin wallet - here we also need to specify the destination chain (as there are different swap protocols available with different on-chain footprints)
const {balance: btcBalance, feeRate: btcFeeRate} = await swapper.Utils.getBitcoinSpendableBalance(bitcoinWalletAddress, "SOLANA");
Unified address parser
A common way for parsing all address formats supported by the SDK, automatically recognizes:

Bitcoin on-chain L1 address formats (p2pkh, p2wpkh, p2wsh, p2wsh, p2tr)
BIP-21 bitcoin payment URI
BOLT11 lightning network invoices
LUD-6 LNURL-pay links
LUD-3 LNURL-withdraw links
LUD-16 Lightning static internet identifiers
Smart chain addresses (Solana, Starknet, etc.)
const res = await swapper.Utils.parseAddress(address);
switch(res.type) {
  case "BITCOIN":
    //Bitcoin on-chain L1 address or BIP-21 URI scheme with amount
    const btcAmount = res.amount;
    break;
  case "LIGHTNING":
    //BOLT11 lightning network invoice with pre-set amount
    const lnAmount = res.amount;
    break;
  case "LNURL":
    //LNURL payment or withdrawal link
    if(isLNURLWithdraw(res.lnurl)) {
      //LNURL-withdraw allowing withdrawals over the lightning network
      const lnurlWithdrawData: LNURLWithdraw = res.lnurl;
      const minWithdrawable = res.min; //Minimum payment amount
      const maxWithdrawable = res.max; //Maximum payment amount
      const fixedAmount = res.amount; //If res.min===res.max, an fixed amount is returned instead
      //Should show a UI allowing the user to choose an amount he wishes to withdraw
    }
    if(isLNURLPay(res.lnurl)) {
      //LNURL-pay or static lightning internet identifier allowing repeated payments over the lightning network
      const lnurlPayData: LNURLPay = res.lnurl;
      const minPayable = res.min; //Minimum payment amount
      const maxPayable = res.max; //Maximum payment amount
      const fixedAmount = res.amount; //If res.min===res.max, an fixed amount is returned instead
      const icon: (string | null) = res.lnurl.icon; //URL encoded icon that should be displayed on the UI
      const shortDescription: (string | null) = res.lnurl.shortDescription; //Short description of the payment
      const longDescription: (string | null) = res.lnurl.longDescription; //Long description of the payment
      const maxCommentLength: (number | 0) = res.lnurl.commentMaxLength; //Maximum allowed length of the payment message/comment (0 means no comment allowed)
      //Should show a UI displaying the icon, short description, long description, allowing the user to choose an amount he wishes to pay and possibly also a comment
    }
    break;
  default:
    //Addresses for smart chains
    break;
}
Manually signing smart chain transactions
You can also sign the transactions on smart chain side (Solana, Starknet, etc.) of the SDK externally by a separate wallet. Each function which executes any transaction has its txs(action) counterpart, e.g.:

commit() -> txsCommit()
claim() -> txsClaim()
commitAndClaim -> txsCommitAndClaim()
refund() -> txsRefund()
After sending the transactions, you also need to make sure the SDK has enough time to receive an event notification of the transaction being executed, for this you have the waitTill(action) functions, e.g.:

commit() -> waitTillCommited()
claim() -> waitTillClaimed()
commitAndClaim -> waitTillClaimed()
refund() -> waitTillRefunded()
//Example for Solana
const txns = await swap.txsCommit(); //Also works with txsClaim, txsRefund, txCommitAndClaim
txns.forEach(val => val.tx.sign(...val.signers));
const signedTransactions = await solanaSigner.wallet.signAllTransactions(txns.map(val => val.tx));
for(let tx of signedTransactions) {
    const res = await solanaRpc.sendRawTransaction(tx.serialize());
    await solanaRpc.confirmTransaction(res);
}
await swap.waitTillCommited(); //Or other relevant waitTillClaimed, waitTillRefunded

//Example for Starknet
const txns = await swap.txsCommit(); //Also works with txsClaim, txsRefund, txCommitAndClaim
for(let tx of txns) {
    if(tx.type==="INVOKE") await starknetSigner.account.execute(tx.tx, tx.details);
    if(tx.type==="DEPLOY_ACCOUNT") await starknetSigner.account.deployAccount(tx.tx, tx.details);
}
await swap.waitTillCommited(); //Or other relevant waitTillClaimed, waitTillRefunded
Additional swapper options
You can further customize the swapper instance with these options, you can:

adjust the maximum accepted pricing difference from the LPs
use custom mempool.space instance
use custom pricing API
use own LP node for swaps
adjust HTTP request timeouts
add parameters to be sent with each LP request
const swapper = Factory.newSwapper({
    ...
    //Additional optional options
    pricingFeeDifferencePPM: 20000n, //Maximum allowed pricing difference for quote (between swap & market price) in ppm (parts per million) (20000 == 2%)
    mempoolApi: new MempoolApi("<url to custom mempool.space instance>"), //Set the SDK to use a custom mempool.space instance instead of the public one
    getPriceFn: (tickers: string[], abortSignal?: AbortSignal) => customPricingApi.getUsdPriceForTickers(tickers) //Overrides the default pricing API engine with a custom price getter

    intermediaryUrl: "<url to custom LP node>",
    registryUrl: "<url to custom LP node registry>",

    getRequestTimeout: 10000, //Timeout in milliseconds for GET requests
    postRequestTimeout: 10000, //Timeout in milliseconds for POST requests
    defaultAdditionalParameters: {lpData: "Pls give gud price"}, //Additional request data sent to LPs

    defaultTrustedIntermediaryUrl: "<url to custom LP node>" //LP node/intermediary to use for trusted gas swaps
});
